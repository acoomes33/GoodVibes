# Installation

# Usage

When visiting the Good Vibes SPA application, there is a navbar on top that will lead you to either the home page where you are welcomed, a songs index page, an albums index page, a create song form, and a create album form. The songs index page shows all the user's created songs with links to each of the song's show page, where you can see more info about the song. The albums index page displays a list of album cards with a more info link to the album's show page. There, a user can see the cover art, name, genre, songs in the album, as well as an 'add songs to album' form that lists all songs that are not in an album yet. A user can click on a song and submit it, and the song will be added to the album. The song form page is where a user can create a song with a name, genre, vibe, bpm, and lyrics. The album form page is where a user can create an album with a name, genre, and cover art. A user can also delete songs and albums through their show page.
